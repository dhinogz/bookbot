# BookBot

A simple book analyzer Python script. Exercise found [here](https://boot.dev/learn/build-local-dev-environment-python)

Prints out the words and letters counts from books found in the books/ directory in a nice, small report. At the moment, only Frankenstein is present. 

## How to run
```
$ python3 main.py
```

## Why?
I haven't been using Python for quite a while, since I've been working on a personal project of mine using [Go](go.dev)

This worked as a quick refresher of the language (took about ~20 minutes) and I took advantage of this opportunity in setting up Python, [ruff formatter](https://beta.ruff.rs/docs/) and [pylsp](https://github.com/python-lsp/python-lsp-server) on [Helix](https://helix-editor.com/), my current text editor. 

Spoiler alert: it's so much better than what I had on VSCode.
